# Name
#   monitor.sh
#
# Description:
#   Shell script for monitoring the appliance.
#
# Usage:
#   Run every minute from cron. For example:
#     * * * * * /root/monitor.sh -h search.google.com -q google >> /tmp/monitor.out
#   The argument following -h is the hostname of the appliance.
#   The argument following -q is a word that appears in a lot of documents,
#   such as your domain name.
#   Optional params: 
#     -s collection_name
#     -f frontend_name
#
# Sample output:
#   Wed Aug 1 16:25:20 PDT 2007  HTTP status: 200 Connect time: 0.023 \
#   Total time: 1.382 Size: 5537 Query: google+OR+23062 \
#   Estimated results: 6530 Curl exit status: 0
#
# Detailed description:
#  * Query strings are unique so that Google support can more easily
#    trace a query to the backend processes
#  * Each monitoring query contains a common string parameter so that 
#    customers can easily remove them from their logs when doing reports.
#  * The time on the monitor machine must be sync'd to the appliance
#    so that the timestamp from the monitor script matches the timestamp
#    in the appliance query logs.
#  * The exit status from curl shows the exact failure mode of the script.
#    See the curl man page for details.
#  * Run a query that doesn't use significant resources on the appliance,
#    such as large value for num or a date sort of all documents.
# 
# This code is not supported by Google
